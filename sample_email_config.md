Dear {hr_name},

I am writing to express my interest in the internship opportunity at {company}. As a pre-final year B.Tech Computer Science student at Technocrats Institute of Technology, Bhopal, I have developed a strong foundation in web development and problem-solving, complemented by hands-on experience building real-world projects.

In my academic and project work, I have:

• Built an AI-powered customer support portal with real-time complaint tracking, Google Authentication, and automated RCA/CAPA suggestions, reducing analysis time by 70%.

• Developed a responsive news website using JavaScript and Bootstrap, simulating a headless CMS with dynamic content loading.  

• Gained practical experience with JavaScript, React.js, Firebase, Supabase, and Python, alongside deployment tools such as Netlify and Vercel.

I am eager to apply these skills to contribute to {company}, learn from industry professionals, and further sharpen my technical expertise. My strengths in collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving make me confident in my ability to add value as an intern.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and projects align with your team's needs. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
{sender_name}
